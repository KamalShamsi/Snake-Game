# Snake Game

## Description
This is a classic snake game built using React and Material UI. The goal of the game is to control a snake that moves around the board, and eat as many pieces of food as possible. The game becomes more challenging as the snake gets longer with each piece of food it eats. The game ends if the snake hits the border or its own body.

## Features
- The game has three levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard.
- The speed of the snake increases as it eats more food.
- There is a pause/resume functionality which allows you to pause the game at any time and resume when ready.
